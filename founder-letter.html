        <h3 class="heading-3">Hey everyone!</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <span>
            I’ve always been one to look for the good in people. So naturally,
            my goal for The Giving App was much more than just creating a
            successful app or nonprofit organization. It was about people
            helping people, and it was about starting a genuine movement. I
            hoped to inspire others to believe that WE could ACTUALLY change the
            world for the better, and that we didn’t need to be a bunch of
            perfect people in order to be a part of it.
          </span>
          <span>
            Our movement would welcome anyone with a desire to give, and it
            would be built on small consistent acts of kindness from ordinary
            people from all walks of life. We would change the game for
            good-intentioned nonprofit organizations, and we’d bring hope and
            change to those who’d need it more than anything. It would take
            time, as all great things do. However, if we’d stay the course and
            keep our intentions pure, my hope was and still is that our mission
            would be blessed and that our giving community would become an
            undeniable force for good… one day.
          </span>

          <span>
            So now, I guess we’re at the very beginning of the “let’s find out”
            stage, but you already know where I’ve placed my bet. I’m all in on
            The Giving App, and what is The Giving App? It’s a mobile giving
            platform that can become the future of philanthropy, but more than
            anything, The Giving App is PEOPLE. It’s You, it’s Me, it’s all of
            Us. We are a community with enough hope to believe that we could
            still make a difference in this world, and I wouldn’t bet against
            us.
          </span>

          <span>
            So whether you’re already part of our community or if you’re just
            hearing about us for the first time, I want you to know that I
            couldn’t be more grateful that you’re here! Our journey’s only just
            begun, and I can’t wait to see what we’ll accomplish in the years to
            come.
          </span>

          <span> Welcome to The Giving App! </span>

          <span> Love, James </span>
